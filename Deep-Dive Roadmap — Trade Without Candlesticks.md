Great — you want a **step-by-step deep dive learning roadmap** to trade **without depending on candlesticks**. I’ve built a structured, practical program you can follow over **12 weeks** (flexible) that covers theory, reading, hands-on exercises, backtesting and live practice — using price structure, volume/market profile, order flow, indicators, IV/Greeks for options, and quant methods. Each week has clear goals, readings, practical tasks and checkpoints. I’ll mix English + Telugu so it’s easy to follow.

# Deep-Dive Roadmap — Trade Without Candlesticks (12 weeks)

**How to use:** Follow week by week. For each week: read the recommended chapter/book sections, do the practice tasks, log results in a simple journal/spreadsheet. Don’t rush — mastery > speed.

---

## Week 0 — Setup (Tools & Data)

**Goal:** Prepare platforms, data and a trading journal.

* Tools to install/sign up:

  * Charting with line/bar/OHLC options: **TradingView** (use Line/Bar mode), **NinjaTrader** / **SierraChart** if you want advanced orderflow.
  * Market data / Options analytics: **Opstra**, **OptionChain (broker)**, **Zerodha Kite** for live ticks.
  * Backtesting / quant: Python (pandas + backtest libs) or **Amibroker/NinjaTrader**.
* Create folders: `Books`, `Backtest`, `Screenshots`, `Journal.xlsx`.
* Create a simple Excel journal columns:

  * Date | Instrument | Timeframe | Direction | Entry price | Exit price | Quantity | P/L (₹) | P/L% | R:R | Setup type | Notes
* Practice: switch chart type to **line** & **bar** and view same timeframe for a few instruments.

**Reading:** Intro chapters from *Technical Analysis of Stock Trends* (Edwards & Magee) — focus on price structure & trend basics.

## Week 1 — Price Structure & Market Context (no candles)

**Goal:** Learn how to read market structure: swing highs/lows, trends, support/resistance using line/bar charts.

* Concepts:

  * Higher highs / higher lows → uptrend; lower highs / lower lows → downtrend.
  * Trendlines, channels using highs/lows (draw on line/bar charts).
  * Timeframe nesting: use 1m / 15m / 1h / daily — observe structure across timeframes.
* Exercises:

  * On 5 different stocks, mark 3 support & 3 resistance levels using only **line chart** closes.
  * Identify trend changes on 15-min charts for last 5 trading days.
* Tools: TradingView (line mode), draw trendlines, save snapshots.
* Checkpoint: You must correctly mark at least 70% of major swings for each stock.

**Reading:** *The Art and Science of Technical Analysis* — chapters on price patterns & structure.

---

## Week 2 — Volume Analysis (No Candles)

**Goal:** Use **volume** with price (line/bar) to validate moves.

* Concepts:

  * Volume confirms moves: price move with high volume = conviction.
  * Volume spikes at support/resistance = accumulation/distribution.
  * Volume bars under price-line: check if volume rising on advances or declines.
* Exercises:

  * For a trending stock, note 10 instances where price move + volume spike produced follow-through.
  * Create Excel: column DateTime, Price (close), Volume, Volume_MA(20). Flag Volume > MA20.
* Lab: Use one stock intraday, mark entries where price breakout with Volume > MA(20).
* Checkpoint: Backtest manually (last 10 breakouts) — percent that resulted in 1× ATR target hit.

**Reading:** *Mind Over Markets* — sections on Market Profile and auction (conceptual parallels to volume).

---

## Week 3 — Market Profile & Volume Profile (Auction Theory)

**Goal:** Understand value area, point of control (POC), TPOs — trade around value.

* Concepts:

  * Market profile: value area (70%), POC, single prints, tails.
  * Volume profile: where most volume traded at prices (VWAP vs POC).
  * Interpretation: balance vs distribution (range compression → breakout probability).
* Exercises:

  * Use any platform that supports volume profile (TradingView has VP; NinjaTrader, SierraChart better).
  * For 5 trading days of one instrument, mark POC and value area. Observe price reaction next day.
* Trading rules:

  * Fade extremes when single prints and weak profile.
  * Trade breakouts when profile shows imbalance + rising volume.
* Checkpoint: Write 5 trade ideas from profile signals and track outcomes.

**Reading:** *Mind Over Markets* & *Markets in Profile* (Dalton) — focus on structure and TPO concept.

---

## Week 4 — Order Flow Basics & Tape Reading

**Goal:** Learn orderflow concepts — market orders, limit orders, footprints (if available).

* Concepts:

  * Buying vs selling pressure, bid/ask prints, speed of prints.
  * Absorption vs momentum: large sells absorbed → buyers strong.
  * Footprint charts (volume at price per candle) — alternative: use level 2 / DOM.
* Exercises:

  * Watch live DOM/level-2 for a liquid big stock (or NIFTY futures). Note moments of bid wall & lift.
  * Record 10 moments where DOM changes preceded price move.
* Tools: Broker DOM or NinjaTrader replay mode.
* Checkpoint: Ability to explain 3 orderflow moves in your journal with timestamps.

**Reading:** *Trading and Exchanges* (Larry Harris) — chapters on order types and market microstructure.

---

## Week 5 — Indicators without Candles (MA, VWAP, ATR, ADX, RSI)

**Goal:** Use moving averages, VWAP, ATR, ADX, RSI on line/bar charts for entries & exits.

* Rules / setups:

  * Trend filter: MA(50) slope, MA(20) cross.
  * Entry: Price closes above MA + VWAP confirmation + volume spike.
  * Stop: ATR(14) * 1.5 below entry (or structure low).
  * Exit: target = 2× ATR or MA(50) retest.
* Exercises:

  * Build a simple MA + VWAP intraday rule and paper trade 20 setups.
  * Calculate ATR in Excel: ATR uses True Range; implement 14-period ATR formula.
* Checkpoint: Track win rate and avg R:R.

**Reading:** *Trading Systems and Methods* (Kaufman) — moving averages and volatility-based methods.

---

## Week 6 — Breakout & Fade Strategies (Structure-based)

**Goal:** Learn breakout entries (momentum) vs fade (mean reversion) using structure and volume.

* Breakout checklist:

  * Price above recent range high (line close) + volume > MA(volume).
  * No heavy resistance on profile/POC near target.
* Fade checklist:

  * Price touching resistance with divergence (RSI) + high volume but quick rejection.
* Exercises:

  * Backtest 30 breakout instances in past 3 months; measure % success within 1× ATR.
  * Backtest 30 fade instances; measure mean reversion success.
* Checkpoint: Decide which approach suits you (trend follower vs mean reversion).

**Reading:** *The Logical Trader* (Mark Fisher) — ACD and opening range based methods (no candles needed).

---

## Week 7 — Options Foundations (IV, Greeks) — no chart candles

**Goal:** Use volatility & Greeks to trade options, independent of candlestick patterns.

* Concepts:

  * IV (Implied Volatility), IV Rank/Percentile.
  * Greeks: Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega.
  * Strategy choice based on IV: buy options when IV low; sell when IV high.
* Practical:

  * Learn to compute breakeven for simple options trades.
  * Paper trade: buy a near-ATM call or put when IV Rank < 20; track P/L vs underlying movement.
* Exercises:

  * For 10 strikes, record IV, Delta, and Premium; note how premium changes with IV move.
* Checkpoint: Ability to choose when to buy vs sell premium logically.

**Reading:** *Options Volatility & Pricing* (Sheldon Natenberg) — focus on Greeks and volatility concepts.

---

## Week 8 — Options Strategies Without Candles

**Goal:** Implement neutral strategies (iron condor/fly), directional spreads using IV/Gamma logic.

* Strategy selection rules:

  * Iron Condor/Iron Fly when IV high and expected range narrow (use IV Rank + Market Profile).
  * Vertical spreads for directional plays (buy call spread vs naked call if expecting big move).
* Exercises:

  * Build 3 paper strategies: short iron condor, debit call spread, long straddle on low IV. Track P/L to expiry.
* Risk rules:

  * Position sizing (max 1–2% capital per trade), defined max loss.
* Checkpoint: Understand margin and maximum risk of each strategy.

**Reading:** Revisit *Natenberg* chapters on strategy & *Trading Systems and Methods* sections on options overlays.

---

## Week 9 — Backtesting & Statistics (Quant basics)

**Goal:** Learn to backtest rules quantitatively to avoid curve-fitting.

* Topics:

  * Simple backtest: entry rule (price cross MA + volume filter), stop = ATR×1.5, target = ATR×2.
  * Metrics: Win rate, avg R:R, expectancy, max drawdown.
* Tools:

  * Excel for simple event-based backtest OR Python (pandas) for robust backtest.
* Exercises:

  * Backtest one intraday rule for last 6 months on NIFTY futures (or 1 stock) and compute metrics.
* Checkpoint: Produce a one-page result: P/L curve, win rate, expectancy.

**Reading:** *Algorithmic Trading* (Ernest Chan) — introductory backtesting ideas.

---

## Week 10 — Automation & Algos (Small projects)

**Goal:** Automate a simple rule or scan: e.g., volume spike breakout alert.

* Project:

  * Create a scanner (TradingView alert script or Python) that flags price > previous range high AND volume > 2×MA(volume).
  * Send alerts, record outcomes for 20 trades.
* If comfortable, try paper trading via API (Kite Connect).
* Checkpoint: Working alert system with at least 10 recorded alerts and outcomes.

**Reading:** *Trading Systems and Methods* chapters on automation; *Ernest Chan* for strategy automation.

---

## Week 11 — Risk Management, Psychology & Journaling

**Goal:** Build trading plan, position sizing, rule for booking profits & cutting losses.

* Rules to set:

  * Max risk per trade (e.g., 1% capital), max daily drawdown (e.g., 3%).
  * Risk-to-reward rule: avoid trades with R:R < 1:1 (unless edge).
  * Predefine adjustments (roll, exit on IV spike).
* Exercises:

  * Complete journal entries for all paper trades; review weekly.
  * Trade management simulation: when to scale in/out, when to hedge with options.
* Checkpoint: Create a one-page “Trading Plan” PDF.

**Reading:** *The Art and Science of Technical Analysis* (psych & discipline sections) and trading psychology resources.

---

## Week 12 — Review, Refine, Go Live (Small size)

**Goal:** Consolidate, review P/L, make changes and trade small size live.

* Tasks:

  * Review backtest & paper trade log: what worked, what failed.
  * Refine rules, stop, target and position-size.
  * Deploy live with **very small capital** (0.5–1% bankroll per trade).
* Ongoing:

  * Weekly review, monthly re-calibration, expand strategies gradually.

# Practical Checklists, Formulas & Quick Excel Snippets

### ATR (14) in Excel (simplified)

Columns: Date, High, Low, Close
TrueRange = MAX(High-Low, ABS(High - PrevClose), ABS(Low - PrevClose))
ATR = SMA(TrueRange, 14)

### Moving Average (Simple)

SMA(n) = AVERAGE(last n closes)

### Volume Spike Flag

VolumeSpike = IF(Volume > AVERAGE(last 20 volumes)*1.5, "Spike","")

### Breakeven options (simple)

Breakeven_call = Strike + Premium
Breakeven_put = Strike - Premium

### Position sizing (fixed fractional)

RiskPerTrade = AccountSize * RiskPercent
Qty = RiskPerTrade / (EntryPrice - StopPrice)

---

# Practice Templates I Recommend You Make

* Excel trade journal (columns listed earlier).
* Backtest sheet with trade list and P/L calculations.
* Volatility tracker: daily IV, IV Rank (manual calculation: rank vs past N days).
* Market profile snapshot folder for each trading day.

---

# Which chapters / book sections to read when (quick map)

* Weeks 1–3: *Edwards & Magee* + *Art & Science* (price structure, trend)
* Weeks 3–5: *Mind Over Markets* (profile) + *Larry Harris* (orderflow)
* Weeks 5–7: *Kaufman* (systems) + *Natenberg* (options Greeks)
* Weeks 8–11: *Ernest Chan* + backtesting chapters in Kaufman & Chan
* Ongoing: blogs, Opstra, exchange data for IV/OI.

---

# Final Tips (Reality checks)

* Trading without candles is possible — success depends on discipline, volume/profile understanding and stats.
* Paper trade for at least 8–12 weeks before deploying capital.
* Keep position sizing conservative; risk management is more important than signals.
* Always verify data alignment (timestamps) when comparing different feeds (you already experienced this).
